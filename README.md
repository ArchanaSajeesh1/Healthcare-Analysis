# Us Healthcare Data Analysis

**üîç PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
Hospitals across the U.S. are focusing to improve patient outcomes while managing rising treatment costs. With access to 55,500 patient records from 10 major hospitals, this project aims to uncover 
data-driven insights into patient admissions, medical conditions, billing trends, and hospital performance. The goal is to empower healthcare leaders with actionable intelligence to optimize costs, 
enhance care quality, and support strategic decision-making through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

**üõ†Ô∏è APPROACH:**
*	Established connection to the healthcare dataset from the designated source.
*	Performed data cleaning and transformation using Power Query to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
*	Designed an efficient data model, including defining relationships and creating DAX measures for key metrics.
*	Developed an interactive Power BI report with dynamic visuals, filters, and KPIs to support data-driven decision-making.

**üõ†Ô∏è TOOLS USED:**
       Power BI, Power Query, DAX
       
**üìä OUTCOMES:**
*	Gender Distribution: Female patients account for the highest proportion of hospital admissions at 50%, followed by male patients at 40%, and non-binary individuals at 10%.
*	Monthly Admissions Trend: The lowest number of admissions occurred in February, while August recorded the highest patient influx across all hospitals.
*	Age Group Insights: The age group 51‚Äì60 years had the highest number of hospital admissions, indicating a greater healthcare burden in late-middle age.
*	Blood Group Trends: Patients with A+ blood type represent the majority of admissions, suggesting possible correlations worth further clinical investigation.
*	Prevalent Medical Conditions: The most frequently diagnosed conditions among admitted patients were Diabetes and Hypertension, highlighting them as major public health concerns.
_	Hospital Utilization: Houston Methodist Hospital reported the highest number of patient admissions, and also recorded the highest total billing amount, indicating both high demand and cost concentration at this facility.
